# Mercor Project - GitHub Repository Complexity Analyzer

## Introduction

I'm thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed the Mercor project! As an aspiring Mercor ML engineer, I'm excited to share my completed project and fulfill all the specified requirements. This README file provides a comprehensive overview of the project and its successful implementation.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have built a Python-based tool that efficiently analyzes GitHub user profiles and identifies the most technically complex repository from their profile. To accomplish this, I harnessed the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and LangChain to assess the complexity of each repository individually.

## Project Requirements

I'm pleased to report that I have met all the project requirements:

### 1. Fetch GitHub User's Repositories

I implemented a feature that fetches a user's repositories from their GitHub user URL, utilizing GitHub's API to retrieve the necessary data.

### 2. Preprocess Code in Repositories

To ensure smooth processing, I incorporated memory management techniques to handle large repositories and files within them. This guarantees that repositories with large Jupyter notebooks or package files do not exceed token limits when passed through GPT.

### 3. Implement Prompt Engineering

I successfully implemented prompt engineering techniques to capture the essence of technical complexity when passing code through GPT for evaluation.

### 4. Identify the Most Technically Complex Repository

My tool can accurately identify the most technically complex repository from the user's profile. I used GPT to provide a detailed justification for the selected repository based on the analysis performed.

### 5. Deploy the Solution

The solution has been deployed on a hosting platform, specifically GitHub Pages. The deployed interface features a user-friendly text box where users can input a GitHub user URL for analysis. After analysis, the interface displays a link to the most complex repository along with GPT's analysis, justifying the selection.

## Project Completion

I am delighted to announce the successful completion of the Mercor project. I have diligently worked on this project, ensuring that all requirements were met and that the final result is a functional and user-friendly tool.

## Thank You

I would like to express my sincere gratitude for considering my application and entrusting me with this project. Completing this project has been a valuable learning experience, and I am eager to discuss it further during the interview process.

If you have any questions or require additional information about the project, please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to the possibility of joining the Mercor team.
